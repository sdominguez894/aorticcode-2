## How to Update This File

Whenever you add a new migration:

1. Add a new row at the **top** of the table (most recent first).
2. Use the timestamp prefix from the migration filename as the **Migration ID**.
3. Provide a concise description (1-2 sentences max).
4. Mark whether itâ€™s an `up/down` pair or one-directional (`up` only).
5. Add your name under **Author** and optional implementation notes.

## Tips for Maintaining the Changelog

- Keep entries **brief but meaningful** â€” focus on *what changed* and *why*.  
- Always update the changelog **in the same commit** as the new migration files.  
- Use UTC timestamps to stay consistent across collaborators.  
- Optionally, link to internal docs or diagrams for major migrations.

Example:
> See `/supabase/docs/diagrams/recommendations_schema_v2.png` for visual layout.

## Summary

It helps developers, clinicians, and reviewers quickly understand:
- When a schema change occurred  
- Who made it  
- What functionality it introduced  

Keeping this file updated ensures your database evolution remains **transparent, traceable, and reviewable**.
